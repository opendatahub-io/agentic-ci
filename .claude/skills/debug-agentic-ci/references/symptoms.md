# Agentic-CI Symptom Catalog

Known failure patterns from this repo's history. Update this file when fixing bugs or adding features that change failure modes.

## Container backend

### Container exits with code 137 (OOM or SIGKILL)
- **Likely cause**: Entrypoint sleep passthrough caused the container to receive SIGKILL on timeout instead of graceful shutdown. Fixed by removing sleep passthrough.
- **Where to look**: `images/runner/shared/entrypoint.sh`, `backends/podman.py` timeout handling

### Container entrypoint bypassed
- **Likely cause**: PodmanBackend was using `--entrypoint` override. Fixed by stopping the bypass so credential setup in entrypoint.sh runs.
- **Where to look**: `backends/podman.py` container launch args

### Container config dirs overwritten with /sandbox paths
- **Likely cause**: Podman backend was injecting OpenShell-style `/sandbox` paths into config dirs. Fixed to use container-appropriate paths.
- **Where to look**: `backends/podman.py` config dir setup, `harness.py` path resolution

### AGENT_ENABLED_PLUGINS not working in OpenShell
- **Likely cause**: Plugin env var wasn't being passed through to the sandbox environment. Fixed by explicitly forwarding it.
- **Where to look**: `backends/openshell/sandbox.py` env var injection, `harness.py`

## Skill engine

### Verdict file missing but agent exited 0
- **Likely cause**: Agent was SIGKILL'd (timeout) after producing output but before writing verdict. The completion validator now checks verdict file existence before promoting SIGKILL exit to success.
- **Where to look**: `skill.py:run_skill()` verdict loading, completion validator logic

### Verdict rejected: string where array expected
- **Likely cause**: LLM returns single values instead of arrays. Fixed by coercing string verdict list fields to arrays.
- **Where to look**: `verdict.py` coercion logic, `skill.py` verdict validation

## Forge (MR/PR operations)

### GitHub comment filtering returns wrong comments
- **Likely cause**: GitHub API pagination or comment type filtering was incorrect. Fixed to properly filter by comment type.
- **Where to look**: `forge.py` GitHub comment methods, API pagination

### GitHub CI status detection wrong
- **Likely cause**: Check runs vs commit statuses weren't both queried. Fixed to check both GitHub status APIs.
- **Where to look**: `forge.py` CI status detection methods

### Artifact files left in commits
- **Likely cause**: `strip_committed_files()` didn't exist. Added to remove skill artifacts from git commits before push.
- **Where to look**: `gates.py:strip_committed_files()`, post-gate execution in `skill.py`

## Credentials and auth

### GCP project ID not resolved
- **Likely cause**: Harness project resolution didn't fall back to `GCP_PROJECT_ID` env var when gcloud config was empty.
- **Where to look**: `harness.py` project resolution, `cli.py` credential setup

### OTEL collector not receiving data
- **Likely cause**: For OpenShell backend, OTEL host networking wasn't configured. Fixed to set up OTEL endpoint forwarding.
- **Where to look**: `otel.py` collector setup, `backends/openshell/` network config

## Jira client

### Markdown formatting lost in ADF roundtrip
- **Likely cause**: `adf_to_text()` was stripping markdown formatting. Fixed to preserve it during conversion.
- **Where to look**: `jira.py:adf_to_text()`

## Container images

### AGENTS.md not found in container
- **Likely cause**: COPY paths in Containerfiles didn't match the repo layout after restructuring.
- **Where to look**: `images/runner/shared/Containerfile.base`, COPY directives

### OpenShell sandbox auto-attaches provider
- **Likely cause**: Default provider attachment behavior interfered with custom credential injection. Fixed by preventing auto-attachment.
- **Where to look**: `backends/openshell/sandbox.py` provider config
